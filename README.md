# hello-world
This repo is for a tutorial to get me started on GitHub. Wish me the best :D

What is a red flower tree if there are no seeds, no pollen, no green grass to sun?
What is the wide earth without bee to bird a tree? to beard a bear or three?
O Lily Grass of Moonlight and shade. O sweet chirping wren of wing woven skein
How across this amorphous plain, you twist above the twilight train
WHAT MORE IS THERE TO KNOW? I travelled alone< i fled at first light
The night of my stay was adrift of what way I now note to Know
